In this analysis, we explored the relationships between weather variables and geographic latitude by accessing real-world data using APIs. First, we collected weather data from cities around the globe, leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API to gather information on temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Using the Geoapify API, we then identified the nearest hotel to each city within a 10-kilometer radius, allowing us to visualize the closest accommodation facilities and annotate our data.


To uncover patterns and trends, we plotted each weather variable against latitude, providing insights into how climate changes across hemispheres. Linear regression analyses revealed correlations between temperature, humidity, and wind speed with latitude, highlighting the differing influences in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This comprehensive analysis provides a valuable understanding of global weather patterns and helps travelers identify the nearest hotels to different cities worldwide.
